# CardioGuard

**Preventive Cardiovascular Wellness Monitoring System**

> **WARNING: EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION ONLY**
> This application does NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
> For medical concerns, consult a qualified healthcare provider.

## Overview

CardioGuard is a student-level health informatics application demonstrating:
- **HL7 FHIR Interoperability**: Convert wearable data to standards-compliant FHIR resources
- **Explainable ML**: Random Forest with SHAP explanations for cardiovascular wellness risk scoring
- **Rule-Based Risk Stratification**: Transparent Green/Yellow/Red categorization
- **Clinician Dashboard**: Streamlit web interface for patient monitoring

**Key Principle**: This is an educational demonstration of health informatics concepts, NOT a medical diagnostic tool.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: CSV upload + simulated streaming from wearable devices
- **Machine Learning**: Ensemble Random Forest model for risk scoring with feature explanations
- **FHIR Integration**: Observations, RiskAssessments, and Flags sent to HAPI FHIR server
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Patient list, risk visualizations, trends, and FHIR export
- **Basic Authentication**: Demo clinician login
- **Docker Deployment**: Single command to start HAPI FHIR + CardioGuard

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.13+ (for local development)

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muazhuja01/CardioGuard.git
   cd CardioGuard
   ```

2. **Start services with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start:
   - HAPI FHIR Server at http://localhost:8080
   - CardioGuard App at http://localhost:8501

3. **Access the application**:
   - **CardioGuard Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501
   - **HAPI FHIR Server UI**: http://localhost:8080

4. **Login credentials** (demo):
   - Username: `clinician1`
   - Password: `demo123`

### Local Development (without Docker)

1. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.13 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start HAPI FHIR server** (Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest
   ```

4. **Train the ML model**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/app.py
   ```

## Data Pipeline

### 1. Feature Engineering

Cardiovascular wellness features derived from wearable data:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `resting_hr_estimate` | Heart rate during low-activity periods (steps < 1000) |
| `activity_score` | Weighted combination: steps (40%) + active_minutes (40%) + distance (20%) |
| `activity_score_percentile` | Global percentile rank of activity score |
| `steps_avg_30d` | 30-day rolling average of daily steps |
| `sleep_hours_avg` | 7-day rolling average of nightly sleep |
| `sleep_hours_avg_7d` | Alias of sleep_hours_avg used by the rule engine |
| `sedentary_ratio` | Proportion of days with < 5000 steps (last 30 days) |
| `workout_consistency` | Proportion of days with workouts (last 30 days) |
| `hr_variability_proxy` | Standard deviation of heart rate (7-day window) |
| `mood_stress_ratio` | Proportion of "Stressed" mood entries (last 14 days) |
| `calories_per_step` | Calories burned per step (efficiency proxy) |
| `avg_hr_to_resting_ratio` | Ratio of average HR to resting HR |
| `steps_trend_7d` | 7-day linear slope of daily steps (units/day) |
| `hr_trend_7d` | 7-day linear slope of average heart rate (units/day) |

### 2. Synthetic Label Generation

Since we lack ground truth cardiovascular outcomes, we create educational labels using domain knowledge:

- **HIGH RISK**: Resting HR > 100 bpm OR sleep < 5.0 hours OR activity score < 10th percentile OR sedentary ratio > 85%
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Resting HR 85-100 bpm OR sleep 5.0-6.5 hours OR activity score 10th-40th percentile OR sedentary ratio 60-85%
- **LOW RISK**: Otherwise

### 3. ML Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier (300 trees)
- **Why**: Robust ensemble that reduces variance through bagging and random feature subsampling
- **Overfitting controls**: `min_samples_split=10`, `min_samples_leaf=4`, `max_features='sqrt'`, 5-fold cross-validation
- **Class weighting**: High-risk class (2) weighted at 2x to reduce missed high-risk cases
- **Explainability**: SHAP values identify top contributing features

### 4. Risk Stratification

| Category | ML Score | Color | Recommendations |
|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Green (Low) | < 0.35 | Green | Maintain activity, monitor monthly |
| Yellow (Medium) | 0.35 - 0.65 | Yellow | Increase activity to 150 min/week, improve sleep |
| Red (High) | >= 0.65 | Red | Schedule wellness consultation, track HR daily |

**Rule Overrides** (force Red regardless of ML score):
- Steps avg (30d) < 500 (near-complete inactivity)
- Sleep avg (7d) < 3.0 hours (severe sleep deprivation)
- Resting HR > 120 bpm (severe tachycardia)

## FHIR Interoperability

CardioGuard converts wearable data to HL7 FHIR R4 resources:

### Observation Mappings

| Wearable Metric | LOINC Code | FHIR Resource |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Steps | 41950-7 | Observation |
| Heart Rate | 8867-4 | Observation |
| Sleep Duration | 93832-4 | Observation |
| Active Minutes | 82290-8 | Observation |
| Calories Burned | 41979-6 | Observation |
| Distance | 41953-1 | Observation |

### Risk Resources

- **RiskAssessment**: ML score, risk level, basis (Observation references), SHAP explanations
- **Flag**: Created for Yellow/Red patients only (status: "active", category: "clinical")

### FHIR Server Interaction

- POST observations in batches of 100
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation to local cache if FHIR unavailable

## UI Dashboard

### Pages

1. **Patient List**: Table view with risk levels (color-coded), filterable
2. **Risk Dashboard**: ML score gauge, top 3 contributing features, recommendations
3. **Trends**: Time-series charts (heart rate, activity, sleep), mood correlation
4. **FHIR Export**: JSON viewer, download FHIR Bundle

### Authentication

Simple demo authentication (hardcoded users):
- `clinician1` / `demo123`
- `admin` / `admin456`

# Run all tests
pytest

# Unit tests only

## Ethical Guidelines

### Language Guidelines

Use: "wellness risk indicator", "preventive monitoring", "activity pattern"
Avoid: "diagnosis", "disease risk", "clinical decision support"

### Disclaimers

Every page displays:
> EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION ONLY

### Data Safety

- Uses smart sampling by default: 500 randomly selected users across their available days (not a fixed row limit)
- No real patient data (synthetic user IDs)
- No emergency alerts (educational only)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file:

```env
FHIR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/fhir
DATASET_PATH=/app/data/raw/fitness_tracker_dataset.csv
MODEL_PATH=/app/models/risk_classifier.pkl
SQLITE_DB_PATH=/app/data/cache/cardioguard.db
```

### Risk Thresholds

Edit `config/risk_thresholds.yaml` to adjust risk categorization rules.
